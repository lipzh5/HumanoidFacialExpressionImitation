# Realistic Humanoid Facial Expression Imitation

- **Women in STEM Research Internship 2025, Macquarie University.**
- **Supervisors:** Prof. Longbing Cao (Distinguished Chair in AI), Penny (Peizhen Li)

## Stage 1: Paper Reading & Target Data Selection (15.Mar.2025~30.Mar.2025)
### Tasks
1. Read the following papers on image animation/motion transfer (**~6 hrs**):
   - [LivePortrait: Efficient Portrait Animation with Stitching and Retargeting Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03168)
  
   ðŸ“£ **Note:** 
   1. You **do not** have to dive into every detail, just try to understand what they are doing, and how this technique
    can be used to transfer motions (or facial expressions) from human to the humanoid robot. 
   2. You are encouraged to write some
    notes or ideas based on your reading  
3. Watch the following videos of "robot imitate human" (our preliminary experimental results) and take screenshot when you feel the 
   the robot really do a good job(**~4 hrs**)

   ðŸ“£ **Note:** 
   1. Include timestamps in your screenshots as indicated in the example image below: ![My Image](./assets/images/screenshot_example.png)
   2. Organize the screenshots into a zipped folder or a .pptx file or any other you preferred formats.
   3. You are encouraged to think about where the imitation results are good and where are bad during watching the videos
