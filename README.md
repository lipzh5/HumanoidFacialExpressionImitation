# Realistic Humanoid Facial Expression Imitation

- **Women in STEM Research Internship 2025, Macquarie University.**
- **Supervisors:** Prof. Longbing Cao (Distinguished Chair in AI), Penny (Peizhen Li)

## Stage 1: Paper Reading & Target Data Selection (15.Mar.2025~30.Mar.2025)
### Tasks
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Read the following papers on image animation/motion transfer (~6 hrs):**
   - [LivePortrait: Efficient Portrait Animation with Stitching and Retargeting Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03168)
  
   üì£ **Note:** 
   1. You **do not** need to dive into every detail‚Äîfocus on understanding the core concepts, what the technique achieves, 
   and how it can be applied to transfer motions or facial expressions from a human to a humanoid robot.
   2. Feel free to take notes or jot down ideas based on your reading.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Watch the following videos of "robot imitating human" (our preliminary experimental results) and capture screenshot when
   the robot performs well(~4 hrs):**

   üì£ **Note:** 
   1. Include timestamps in your screenshots, following the example image below: ![My Image](./assets/images/screenshot_example.png)
   2. Organize the screenshots into a zipped folder, a .pptx file, or any other preferred format.
   3. As you watch, reflect on where the imitation results are successful and where they fall short.
